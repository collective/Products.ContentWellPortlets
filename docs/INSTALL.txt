Products.ContentWellPortlets Installation
==========================

= Prerequisites =
Plone 4.0 or higher

= Instructions =
To install Products.ContentWellPortlets into your Plone site, you have various options

(Either)
= A. Install as an old style Zope 2 Product =
Because its top level Python namespace package is called ``Products``, this
package can be installed in Zope 2 as an old style **Zope 2 Product** as follows:
 (a) Check Products.ContentWellPortlets out of subversion onto somewhere on your file system, or untar the tarball

 (b) Move (or symlink / soft link) the ``ContentWellPortlets`` folder
     (``Products.ContentWellPortlets/Products/ContentWellPortlets``) into the ``Products`` directory of
     the Zope instance it has to be installed for, and restart the server.

 (c) You should see ContentWellPortlets available in the portal_quickinstaller and Add/Remove Products pane of the Plone Control Panel

(Or)
= B. Install using buildout =
If you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe, you can do this:

== B1. To install the latest tagged release ==
 (i) Add ``Products.ContentWellPortlets`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.:

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        Products.ContentWellPortlets

 (ii) Stop Zope and re-run buildout, e.g. with:

    $ ./bin/buildout -N

 (iii) Restart Zope; you should see ContentWellPortlets available in the portal_quickinstaller and Add/Remove Products pane of the Plone Control Panel

== B2. To install the latest version of the trunk as a development egg ==
 (i) Get the product buildout.eggtractor if you don't already have it, as follows:
 * Add "extensions = buildout.eggtractor" to the "parts" section of your buildout.cfg
    [parts]
    ...
    extensions = buildout.eggtractor
 * Save these changes to buildout.cfg
 * Stop Zope and re-run buildout, e.g. with:

    $ ./bin/buildout -N

 (ii) Check the trunk of Products.ContentWellPortlets out of subversion onto somewhere on your file system
      (see setup.py for details of subversion location)

 (iii) Move or softlink Products.ContentWellPortlets into the /src folder alongside your buildout.cfg

 (iv) Make sure Zope isn't running and rerun buildout with the -o flag:
    $ ./bin/buildout -o
